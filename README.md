# StarkDevs
A web platform designed for developers to practice their Cairo smart contract coding skills.

## About

StarkDevs is a user-friendly, two-step web platform tailored for developers aiming to build expertise and learn Cairo smart contracts. Simply connect your wallet, choose a challenge, and start coding! ðŸš€

# KEY FEATURES
### Smart Contracts Challenges
StarkDevs offers real-world-inspired challenges where developers work on partially completed smart contracts. The goal is to complete the missing parts to pass all tests successfully, providing a hands-on learning experience.

### Smart Contract Interaction & Abstraction
This feature takes the developer's understanding of smart contracts to the next level. While tools like Starklings and NodeGuardians focus on teaching how to write smart contracts, StarkDevs creates a safe and engaging environment where you can see these concepts applied in practice.

With StarkDevs, developers can interact with deployed smart contracts on the Starknet testnet, performing read/write calls on the contracts scenario they've code. This interactive approach helps developers grasp Web3 concepts, understand security considerations, and see the real-time effects of their code, increasing learning and confidence in smart contract development.

## The Stack
The application is built with Next.js and leverages Wasm-Cairo, a WASM runtime environment for Cairo. This allows us to compile and test smart contracts, ensuring their expected behavior and providing the ability to perform comprehensive evaluations.
